 * @brief Basic logging of binary data to files using the C api.
 *
 * The default format includes an 8 byte file header described in LogSink.hpp,
 * a 32 byte record header per message, and no file footer. These are all
 * configurable.
 *
 * Note that the "echo" function of the underlying file sink is not respected.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS: This sink records severity and size as four byte ints, limiting
 * the maximum record size to 4GB and the maximum severity to 2^31 - 1
